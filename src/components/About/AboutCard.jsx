            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Eran Hasarali</span> from
            <span className="purple"> Horana, Sri Lanka</span>.
            <br />
            I'm a passionate and self-driven full-stack developer in training,
            currently focusing on building real-world projects while freelancing
            on various web development gigs.
            <br />
            <br />I hold a <b>Diploma in Information Technology</b> and have
            successfully completed courses such as
            <i>
              {" "}
              <b className="purple">"Python for Beginners"</b>{" "}
            </i>{" "}
            and
            <i>
              {" "}
              <b className="purple">"Python Programming"</b>{" "}
            </i>{" "}
            conducted by the University of Moratuwa (UOM).
            <br />
            Iâ€™m also diving deep into the <b className="purple">
              MERN stack
            </b>{" "}
            and <b className="purple">GoLang</b> to strengthen both frontend and
            backend skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me enjoying a few of my
            favorite hobbies:
